## Projects

### Project 1 : Hyperstack

This was my first big opportunity to work as a QA Engineer. My main responsibility was to test all incoming Web App changes from the Platform team.
This meant building, implementing and integrating a testing process that was lean and lightweight, but robust enough to expand as the business grew.
During my time here I implemented the use of TestRail for test case management and streamlining the QA Process

### Project 2 : MobilePermissions.comÔªø
This is the website to find teachers for different subjects by student. One can register as a tutor or student. It is also used ti book different types of courses. My main task was to test the site from both the tutor and student end and check the workflow.
