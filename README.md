## üì¶ Projects :

### Project 1: Hyperstack

This was my first big opportunity to work as a QA Engineer. My main responsibility was to test all incoming Web App changes from the Platform team.
This meant building, implementing and integrating a testing process that was lean and lightweight, but robust enough to expand as the business grew.
During my time here I implemented the use of TestRail for test case management and streamlining the QA Process

### Project 2: MobilePermissions.comÔªø
This is the website to find teachers for different subjects by student. One can register as a tutor or student. It is also used ti book different types of courses. My main task was to test the site from both the tutor and student end and check the workflow.

### Project 3: MyHobbyCourses.com
This is the website to find teachers for different subjects by student. One can register as a tutor or student. It is also used ti book different types of courses. My main task was to test the site from both the tutor and student end and check the workflow.

### Project 4: Positive Affirmation App
Positive affirmations are powerful tools for personal growth and mental well-being. These repeated statements can help reshape our thought patterns and create a more optimistic headspace. By consistently practising daily mantras, individuals can boost self-esteem, reduce stress, and feel better about themselves and their lives.
